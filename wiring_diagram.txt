SHT20 Sensor Wiring Diagram for Raspberry Pi:

This diagram shows how to connect the SHT20 Temperature and Humidity Sensor to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

Connections:
- SHT20 VCC --> Raspberry Pi 3.3V (Pin 1)
- SHT20 GND --> Raspberry Pi GND (Pin 6)
- SHT20 SDA --> Raspberry Pi GPIO 2 (SDA) (Pin 3)
- SHT20 SCL --> Raspberry Pi GPIO 3 (SCL) (Pin 5)

   | Raspberry Pi    |        | SHT20 Sensor    |
   |                 |        |                 |
   |   3.3V (Pin 1)  | ------ | VCC             |
   |    GND (Pin 6)  | ------ | GND             |
   | GPIO 2 (Pin 3)  | ------ | SDA             |
   | GPIO 3 (Pin 5)  | ------ | SCL             |
   |                 |        |                 |

Note:
- Ensure that the I2C interface is enabled on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this by running `sudo raspi-config` and navigating to "Interfacing Options" > "I2C".
- The pin numbers in this diagram are based on the Raspberry Pi's physical pin layout.
